Folds used with the Wachtberg dataset in [1]

Description: We provide here the Wachtberg Dataset used in [1]. 
Also included is the used mapping form original classes to 
relevant classes. The dataset was recorded with a Velodyne HDL-64 SE
mounted on a car and the pose of the car was estimated with an IMU.

The format of the files is the same as used in the Freiburg 360 dataset:

scan_i_robotPoses.dat contains the positions of the robot according to a IMU.
The poses are given as 3D position and Euler angles in the order 
x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw.

scan_i_points.dat contains the laser range points in the robot coordinate system
and the position of the sensor from which this point was measured.
The order is sensorPosX, sensorPosY, sensorPosZ, pointX, pointY, pointZ.

scan_i_labels.dat contains the labeling of a scan, where the order of the labels is the 
same as in the point data. Every line contains a label of the respective point.

The labels have the following encoding: 0 = no label, 1 = car, 2 = ground, 
3 = vegetation, 4 = people, 5 = sign, 6 = tree trunk, 7 = sidewalk, 
8 = facade, 9 = parking area, 10 = lane marking, 11 = lawn, 12 = curb, 
13 = pole, 14 = foliage, 15 = shrub, 16 = window, 17 = door, 18 = roof, 
19 = bicycle, 20 = stairs.

The labels used in [1] have the following encoding: 2 = ground,
8 = facade, 13 = pole, 1 = vehicle, 14 = vegetation.

The file 'wachtberg_mapping.xml' contains the relevant labels and the mapping
from one to another class. The rest of the classes are simply ignored in
the evaluation.
